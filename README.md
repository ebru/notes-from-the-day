# notes from the day.
This is a little diary for me to track the progress, learning or any finding for each day.

I have taken some notes as little snippets starting in May 2019 that I have found useful to keep as a reminder or just with the purpose of setting starting points. 

Since I have really enjoyed reading them again some time to time, I decided to make this public considering it might be useful for anyone and keep it in this way from now on.

There might be things that I have expressed, known or typed wrong. If there is anything you would like to fix please feel free to open a pull request.

Here go the ones so far, happy learning ðŸš€

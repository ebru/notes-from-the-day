# notes from the day.
This is a little diary for me to track the progress, learning or any finding for each day.

I have taken some notes as little snippets starting in May 2019 that I have found useful to keep as a reminder or just with the purpose of setting starting points. 

Since I have really enjoyed reading them again some time to time, I decided to make this public considering it might be useful for anyone and keep it in this way from now on.

There might be things that I have expressed, known or typed wrong. If there is anything you would like to fix please feel free to open a pull request.

Here go the ones so far, happy learning ðŸš€

- Practical **React Query**

https://tkdodo.eu/blog/practical-react-query

Not everything should be handled by `react-query` or `redux` for example, like in the days it was a popular choice for each need. 
Especially wrapping all backend calls to a global state is meaningless.

Be aware of the needs of a global state and store; 

- For handling `backend state and its side effects` like `loading, error, data` -> `react-query`, `swr` etc.

- `Local global state` needs like token, theme, selectedLanguage etc. -> `context`, `zustand`, `redux` etc.

- Persistent storage -> AsyncStorage, encrpypted storages etc.


```
"For years, we've made the mistake of treating every state equally by treating our server data like client state.
We've finally realized that this is sub-optimal, because they have different needs.
Let's not make the same mistake again in the other direction by wanting to do everything with react query please."
